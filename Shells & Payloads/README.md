# Shells & Payloads

## Bind Shells

### What is it?

Bind shells are shells that we use to connect to a server

We are the attacker (**Client**) and the server is the one getting exploited (**Victim**)

To use binding shells, we use **Netcat**

We need the **IP adress** and **port number**

There can be many challenges associated with getting a shell this way. Here are some to consider:

- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

### Creating a TCP session with Netcat

This is a simple demonstration of how netcat works

Setting up the server to listen on port 7777 on their IP adress 

```console
htb-student@ubuntu:~$ nc -lvnp 7777
Listening on 0.0.0.0 7777

```

Our connection to the server

```console
client@attacker:~$ nc -nv 10.129.201.134 7777
Ncat: Connected to 10.129.201.134:7777.

```

You should have something looking like this

How you can now send text from the client to the server in the TCP protocol as seen in the picture. This is only a Netcat TCP session that we have established. The next one is for opening up a shell on the victims computer and passing through commands
