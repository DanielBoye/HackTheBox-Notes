# Deobfuscate Javascript

http://www.jsnice.org/

Tip: We should click on the options button next to the "Nicify JavaScript" button, and de-select "Infer types" to reduce cluttering the code with comments.

Tip: Ensure you do not leave any empty lines before the script, as it may affect the deobfuscation process and give inaccurate results.
